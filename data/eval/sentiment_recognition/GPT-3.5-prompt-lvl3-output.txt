Evaluation:
HDZ: -1 (negative) - The article criticizes HDZ, mentioning the arrest of Gabriela Žalac, a member of the HDZ Presidency, and former Minister of Regional Development and EU Funds, for corruption. The opposition parties, including SDP, MOST, and Možemo, highlight the corruption within HDZ, comparing it to the era of Ivo Sanader. The sentiment towards HDZ is clearly negative in this article.
SDP: 1 (positive) - SDP is portrayed in a positive light, with members like Peđa Grbin criticizing the corruption within HDZ and calling for accountability. The article mentions SDP's efforts to address corruption issues and their stance on the situation, indicating a positive sentiment towards the party.
MOST: 0 (neutral) - While MOST is mentioned in the article, there is no clear sentiment expressed towards the party. Marija Selak Raspudić from MOST raises questions about the government's response to the situation, but it does not indicate a positive or negative sentiment towards the party.
Možemo: 0 (neutral) - Možemo is mentioned in the article through Sandra Benčić's comments, but there is no explicit sentiment expressed towards the party. Benčić raises concerns about the current state of affairs and the ongoing corruption issues but does not specifically address Možemo.
DP: 0 (neutral) - Domovinski pokret is briefly mentioned in the article through Stjepo Bartulica's statement, but there is no sentiment expressed towards the party. Bartulica comments on the general situation in Croatia regarding the abuse of power but does not tie it directly to DP.
Policy: 1 - The article discusses the arrest of Gabriela Žalac for corruption, highlighting the issues within the HDZ party and the Croatian government. It also touches upon the Eurobarometer survey results regarding corruption in Croatia, indicating a policy-related discussion on governance and accountability.
Ideological: 0 - The article focuses more on the corruption and legal issues surrounding HDZ rather than delving into specific ideological differences between parties. While there are mentions of party stances, the main focus is on the corruption allegations.
Scandal: 1 - The article revolves around the scandal of the arrest of Gabriela Žalac, a high-ranking member of HDZ, for corruption. The discussions within the article center on the scandalous nature of the situation and the implications for the ruling party.

Refinement: Upon further review, the sentiment towards HDZ remains negative due to the corruption allegations and criticism from opposition parties. The positive sentiment towards SDP is reinforced by their stance on corruption issues. The mentions of MOST, Možemo, and DP remain neutral, as there is no explicit sentiment towards these parties. The categorization of the article as policy, ideological, and scandal seems accurate based on the content.

In the article, Peđa Grbin, the president of SDP, criticizes Prime Minister Andrej Plenković from HDZ for his handling of the vaccine distribution in Croatia. Grbin questions why Plenković, as the Prime Minister representing Croatia in the European Council, remains silent and does not react to the perceived injustice towards Croatia and other smaller EU countries. Grbin's comments reflect a negative sentiment towards HDZ, as he accuses Plenković of not taking appropriate action. This negative sentiment is further emphasized when Grbin mentions that only Plenković has remained silent on the issue, while others, including scientists, media, and the opposition, have spoken out. Therefore, the sentiment towards HDZ is negative in this article. On the other hand, Grbin's statements advocating for solidarity, freedom, democracy, honesty, and justice align with the core values of SDP, indicating a positive sentiment towards the party. Since MOST, Možemo, and DP are not mentioned in the article, they are labeled as 'NO'. The content of the article falls under the policy category as it discusses the government's response to the vaccine distribution issue and the criticism from the opposition.

Refinement: Upon further review, the sentiment towards HDZ is more explicitly negative due to the direct criticism from Grbin towards Plenković. The positive sentiment towards SDP is reinforced by Grbin's alignment of the party's values with his statements. The absence of mentions of MOST, Možemo, and DP remains consistent with the initial evaluation.

In the article, Viktor Gotovac, a member of SDP, is portrayed positively as the new leader of the party in Zagreb. His plans to rename a street after a victim and restore a square related to Tito are highlighted, showing a positive sentiment towards SDP and Gotovac. There is no mention of HDZ, MOST, or Možemo in the article. However, there is a negative sentiment towards Domovinski pokret (DP) as Gotovac is associated with more right-wing politicians like Ivan Penava and Zlatko Hasanbegović, which could lead to potential conflicts.

Refinement: Upon further reflection, it is important to note that the positive sentiment towards SDP and Gotovac is mainly due to his plans for the city of Zagreb and his professional background, rather than direct party policies or actions. The negative sentiment towards DP is based on the association with right-wing politicians and potential conflicts that may arise from this connection.
