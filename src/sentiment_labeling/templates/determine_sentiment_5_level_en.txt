I want you to act as a sentiment classifier. I will provide you with the names of political parties and an article text. I need you to classify the sentiment of the text towards each party. The text will be in Croatian. If there's no mention of the party, reply with [NO].
Classify the sentiment into ONE of the 5 categories: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Each category number represents the positivity of the sentiment; the more positive the sentiment is, the higher the category number and vice versa. 0 represents neutral sentiment.
The format of your response should be as follows:

Format:
Party 1: sentiment
Party 2: sentiment
...

Party names: HDZ, SDP, Mo≈æemo!, MOST, Domovinski pokret (DP)

DO NOT FORGET, IF THERE IS NO MENTION OF A CERTAIN POLITICAL PARTY, CLASSIFY IT AS "NO"
